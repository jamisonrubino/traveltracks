# TravelTracks

TravelTracks is a small, Ruby on Rails-based app to generate playlists of a given length. The Google Directions API implementation is, unfortunately, **deprecated**, but custom time input still works.

### Auth
Sign into your Spotify account to be redirected to TravelTracks. TravelTracks only saves your user ID and URIs of playlists generated by TravelTracks.

### Music Source
Choose one of four music sources for your playlist: a blend of up to three genres (from Spotify's complete list of genres), recommendations based on an artist, your recently-saved tracks, or your 50 most-played tracks for the last 6 months.

Submit and enjoy!
